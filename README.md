# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata C# - Assignment 2

## Repo Setup
1. **Create a Public GitHub Repository**
   - Created a github organization named TEAM2-SWE6733-SP2025 and added all of our team members to the group.
   - Created a repo named GuildedRose-csharp.

## Collaboration Tools and Rationale
- **Tool(s) Used:** Microsoft Teams, VS Code, and Live Share feature of VS Code.
- **Rationale:** Teams allowed our team members to share the same screen and communicate, and VS Code and the Live Share feature allowed everyone access to the files that we wrote test and refactored the kata.

## Gilded Rose Kata Implementation Steps
### 1. Adding Code
- Cloned the C# version this repository and add the base Gilded Rose code.
- Push the initial code to the repository.

### 2. Writing Unit Tests
- Used XUnit to write unit tests.
- Captured 100% code coverage before refactoring code.
- Capture a **video recording** of the mob session (optional) and upload it.

### 3. Code Coverage
- Included screenshot of the coverage results as `code-coverage.png`.

### 4. Verifying Unit Tests
- Ensured all unit tests pass.
- Included screenshot as `test-results.png`.

### 5. Refactoring for Clean Code
- Improve the structure and readability of the Gilded Rose code.
- Remove code smells and enhance maintainability.
- Capture a **video recording** of the mob session (optional) and upload it.

### 6. Implementing New Features (TDD)
- Add support for **Conjured items**, ensuring they degrade twice as fast.
- Write new test methods starting with "conjured" to verify behavior.
- Capture a **video recording** of the mob session (optional) and upload it.
